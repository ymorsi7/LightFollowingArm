# LightFollowingArm
## December 8 2020
The objective of this project, which was a part of my ECE 5: Introduction to Electrical Engineering course, was to enhance my understanding of photoresistors, MATLAB, Arduino and Arduino-C, servo motors, and PID Control Systems. Using a PID Control System involves altering different variables to produce a wanted output (in this case, the PID variables were changeable through a MATLAB GUI interface.
